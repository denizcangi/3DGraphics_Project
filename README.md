# 3DGraphics_Project
Sabanci University Fall 2020-2021 CS 405 Computer Graphics 3D Graphics Project

In this 3D project, I used OpenGL WHÄ°CH is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. Also in the project I used GLFW 3.3.2 OpenGL library. For OpenGL loading library (OpenGL function loader) I used GLAD.
